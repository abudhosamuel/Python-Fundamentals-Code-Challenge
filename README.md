# Python Coding Assessment

This repository contains solutions to the Python Coding Assessment, covering basic Python concepts such as data structures, functions, decorators, and object-oriented programming.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Run the Python script in the terminal:


## Running the Application

The `assessment.py` script contains the following functions:

- `add_numbers(num1, num2)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- `is_even(number)`: Checks if a number is even.
- `reverse_string(text)`: Reverses a given string.
- `count_vowels(text)`: Counts the number of vowels in a string.
- `calculate_factorial(n)`: Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- `apply_decorator(func)`: Applies a decorator that prints a message before executing a function.
- `sort_by_age(list_of_tuples)`: Sorts a list of tuples by age.
- `merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)`: Merges two dictionaries, summing values for common keys.

Additionally, the `Car` class can be used to create Car objects with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. The `display_info` method prints the car's details.

run the file using;
